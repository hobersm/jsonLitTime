Then each member of the team was solemnly given a glassful of sweet and sticky port, and we rushed straight from the table out to the hockey field. I found the port extremely nasty and difficult to swallow; and everyone complained that it made them feel sick; still, it was an honour to get it, so we drank it gratefully.
